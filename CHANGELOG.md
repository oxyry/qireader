- Article List: Added grid view.
- Article List: The “Read / Unread / Read later” markers are now clickable to toggle their current state.
- Added a new keyboard shortcut, “U”, for navigating back to the previous level. In most cases it works the same as the Left Arrow key and the “H” key, but you cannot use arrow keys to return to the left sidebar when in grid view; in that case, you can use “U” to switch back to the left sidebar.
- The Up/Down arrow keys no longer select the previous/next item; they now scroll the view instead. J/K still select the previous/next item as before.
- Left Sidebar: Clicking the currently selected feed will now refresh the article list.
- When opening a feed or an article, its corresponding URL will now be appended after the “#” in the address bar.
- On desktop, clicking the empty area of the toolbar no longer scrolls the page to the top.
- Improved loading performance with a large number of feeds and reduced memory usage.
